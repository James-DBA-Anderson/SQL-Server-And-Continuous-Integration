It's not a suite of tools<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<br>
Moving quickly from ideas to production
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<br>
Continually integrating

What do I need for CI?


<br>

GitLab Features

<br>

Tests

<br>
* tSQLt

So now we have automatic testing everytime we make a change.
